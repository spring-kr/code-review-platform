description: "Analyze recorded skill usage in this project (.claude/learning/runs.jsonl, written by self-learning) and the skills installed in .claude/skills/ to produce a usage and KPI report - which skills are actively used and reliable, which are failing, and which are unused or low-value, with recommendations on what to add or remove. Use when asked for \"skill usage stats\", \"skill KPIs\", \"which skills should we add or remove\", or \"are our installed skills still useful\"."

# Skill Usage Insights

Turn `.claude/learning/runs.jsonl` (the [[self-learning]] run log) and the
contents of `.claude/skills/` into a per-skill usage/KPI report, with
add/remove recommendations.

## 1. Gather inputs

- `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — skills currently installed in this
  project (one directory per skill).
- `.claude/learning/runs.jsonl` — append-only JSON-lines log; each line:
  `{"ts": ..., "skill": ..., "action": ..., "rc": 0|nonzero, "duration": ..., "error": "", "hint": "", "note": ""}`.
  If this file doesn't exist, say so plainly — there's no usage history yet,
  not an error. Recommendations in that case are limited to "not yet
  measurable; check back after the self-learning skill has recorded some
  runs".
- `.claude/learning/skill-feedback.jsonl` — user negative reactions per skill
  (written by [[skill-feedback-adaptation]]). Use for **inefficiency %** and
  update suggestions alongside run-based KPIs.
- Optionally, `.claude/learning/task-skill-proposals.json` — latest task-scoped
  skill proposals (also from [[skill-feedback-adaptation]]).
- Optionally, the library's `manifest.json` (wherever the skill library
  lives, e.g. `~/.claude/skills/` or a synced `skills_library/`) — useful to
  see a skill's `detect_globs`/description when judging relevance.

## 2. Aggregate per skill

For each installed skill name, and for each distinct `skill` value in
`runs.jsonl` that matches an installed skill name:

- `runs` — count of matching records.
- `success_rate` — `rc == 0` count / `runs` (as a percentage).
- `avg_duration` — mean of `duration` across records that have it.
- `last_used` — max `ts`; `days_since_last_use` — days between that and now.
- **Per agent** — when `agent` is set on a row (`claude`, `cursor`, `kiro`,
  `copilot`), group invocations by agent. The VS Code Usage Report shows a
  **Skill usage by agent** section and a matrix for skills used by more than
  one agent on the same workspace (common when switching between Claude Code,
  Cursor, Kiro, and Copilot on one task). Rows without `agent` count as Claude.
- Records whose `skill` value doesn't match any installed skill name are
  general task-tracking entries (per [[self-learning]]'s schema) — ignore
  them for this report, but you may mention the count as "N other tracked
  task runs not tied to a specific skill".

## 3. KPI rating per skill

Apply these thresholds (same as the VS Code extension's status bar/report,
for consistency):

| Rating | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Active** | `runs >= 2` and `days_since_last_use <= 30` and not failing badly |
| **Needs attention** | `runs >= 3` and `success_rate < 60%` |
| **Low usage** | `runs >= 1` but doesn't qualify as Active (rare or stale) |
| **Unused** | Installed, but zero matching records in `runs.jsonl` |

### Inefficiency (user feedback)

For each skill with entries in `skill-feedback.jsonl`:

- `negative_count` — number of negative/correction records.
- `inefficiency_pct` — higher when more feedback relative to other skills
  (extension scales 0–100%; more feedback → deeper red in Usage Report).
- **Update suggestion** — recommend SKILL.md edits when `negative_count >= 3`,
  or point at `session-learnings.md` / feedback `context` fields for fixes.

Deprioritize skills with high inefficiency when recommending additions unless
no alternative exists.

## 4. Recommendations

- **Needs attention**: don't recommend removal outright — first point at
  `.claude/learning/patterns.md` (or the raw failing records) for the
  recurring error text, since the fix may be a one-line correction to the
  skill's instructions or `allowed-tools`. Only suggest removal if the
  skill's premise itself seems wrong for this project (e.g. a Terraform
  skill in a project with no `.tf` files).
- **Unused**: if installed very recently (check `SKILL.md` mtime or git log
  for `.claude/skills/<name>/`), say "too soon to tell". Otherwise flag as a
  removal candidate — but removal is a user decision, never delete
  `.claude/skills/<name>/` without explicit confirmation.
- **Low usage**: keep if the skill's purpose is inherently occasional (e.g.
  a release/deploy skill used once a sprint) — judge by the skill's
  description, not just the number.
- **Gaps (skills to add)**: cross-reference the project's file types against
  the library's `manifest.json` `detect_globs` (same detection the
  `claude-skills-deployer` CLI/extension use). If a library skill matches
  files present in this project but isn't installed, list it as a candidate
  to add — especially if `runs.jsonl` shows repeated manual `task` entries
  whose description overlaps with that skill's purpose.

## 5. Output format

A short table (Skill | Runs | Success % | By agent | Last used | Rating | Note),
then 2-4 sentences of plain-language recommendation. When multiple agents
invoked the same skill, call that out explicitly. Keep it concise — this is a
status check, not an audit report. If the user just wants the headline
numbers (e.g. "how many skills are active"), answer directly without the
table.

## 6. Hand-offs

- Investigating a specific failing skill's errors → [[self-learning]]
  (`patterns.md`, `session-learnings.md`).
- Installing a recommended-to-add skill, or removing one → the
  `claude-skills-deployer` CLI (`generate_skills.py`) or its VS Code
  extension's tree view / "Install to Workspace" command.
