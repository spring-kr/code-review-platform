# File Style Conventions

Two small, easy-to-violate-by-accident conventions enforced on every file
write/edit:

## 1. No emoji outside Markdown

- Files with extension `.md` (or `.mdx`) may contain emoji **if the user
  asked for them** — don't add emoji proactively even there.
- **Every other file type** (source code, YAML/JSON/TOML config, shell/PS1
  scripts, Dockerfiles, CI configs, etc.) must contain **no emoji
  characters** at all — including in comments, log messages, string
  literals, and commit messages/PR titles (these aren't files, but the same
  rule applies).
- Why: emoji can break strict-encoding parsers, inflate diffs with
  multi-byte sequences, misrender in some terminals/log viewers, and are
  inconsistent with this project's style.
- Before finalizing a non-`.md` file you wrote/edited, scan for emoji (common
  ranges: `U+1F300`–`U+1FAFF`, `U+2600`–`U+27BF`, `U+2190`–`U+21FF` arrows
  used decoratively, variation selectors `U+FE0F`). If found, replace with
  plain text (e.g. `[OK]`/`[FAIL]` instead of check/cross emoji, `->` instead
  of arrow emoji) or remove entirely.

## 2. YAML files end with a trailing newline

- Every `.yml`/`.yaml` file must end with exactly one `\n` (the file's last
  byte is a newline, and there is no trailing blank line beyond it).
- This matches the POSIX "text file ends with a newline" convention, avoids
  `git diff` showing `\ No newline at end of file`, and satisfies
  `yamllint`'s `new-line-at-end-of-file` rule (the default in most CI lint
  jobs — see `ci-pipeline-debug`/`gitlab-pipeline-ops`).
- After writing/editing a `.yml`/`.yaml` file, verify:
  ```bash
  tail -c1 path/to/file.yml | od -c | head -1   # should show \n, not empty
  ```
  or in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  $bytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("path/to/file.yml")
  $bytes[-1] -eq 10   # 10 = LF; should be True
  ```
- If missing, append a single newline — don't add multiple blank lines at
  end of file.

## Scope

These checks apply to files this skill's user is actively creating or
editing — don't do a repo-wide sweep reformatting unrelated files unless
asked. If a pre-existing file already violates one of these conventions and
you're touching it for an unrelated reason, fix the convention issue too
while you're there (it's a one-line change), but mention it briefly.
